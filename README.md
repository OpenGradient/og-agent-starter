# OpenGradient Agent Starter Kit

Defines a simple starter agent that runs on OpenGradient's verifiable LLM inference and reasoning.

We provide 2 starter kits:

1. Uses `LangChain`
2. Uses OpenAI's `Swarm` framework

Both agents are equipped with Coinbase's [AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-agentkit) for making on-chain transactions as well as a Twitter toolbox for read and write access to X.
